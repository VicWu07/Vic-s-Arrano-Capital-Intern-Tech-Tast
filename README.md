Hi Kelvin and whoever see this repository.
I am using Jupyter Notebook for this Project.

To see how to save data into database, open the file "GetDataFromCoingecko.ipynb"
To see the three queries asked by you, directly open the file "Example Queries.ipynb"

Before your steps, please download all the files and save them to the same path.
